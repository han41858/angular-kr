Stability ensures that reusable components and libraries, tutorials, tools, and learned practices don't become obsolete unexpectedly. Stability is essential for the ecosystem around Angular to thrive.</p>\n<p>We also share with you the desire for Angular to keep evolving. We strive to ensure that the foundation on top of which you are building is continuously improving and enabling you to stay up-to-date with the rest of the web ecosystem and your user needs.</p>\n<p>This document contains the practices that we follow to provide you with a leading-edge app development platform, balanced with stability. We strive to ensure that future changes are always introduced in a predictable way. We want everyone who depends on Angular to know when and how new features are added, and to be well-prepared when obsolete ones are removed.</p>\n<p>See <a href=\"guide/updating\" title=\"Updating your projects\">Updating your projects</a> for information about how to update your apps and libraries to the latest version of Angular.</p>\n<div class=\"alert is-helpful\">\n<p>The practices described in this document apply to Angular 2.0 and later. If you are currently using AngularJS, see <a href=\"guide/upgrade\" title=\"Upgrading from Angular JS\">Upgrading from AngularJS</a>. <em>AngularJS</em> is the name for all v1.x versions of Angular.</p>\n</div>\n<a id=\"angular-versioning\"></a>\n<h2 id=\"angular-versioning\">Angular versioning<a title=\"Link to this heading\" class=\"header-link\" aria-hidden=\"true\" href=\"guide/releases#angular-versioning\"><i class=\"material-icons\">link</i></a></h2>\n<p>Angular version numbers indicate the level of changes that are introduced by the release. This use of <a href=\"https://semver.org/\" title=\"Semantic Versioning Specification\">semantic versioning</a> helps you understand the potential impact of updating to a new version. </p>\n<p>Angular version numbers have three parts: <code>major.minor.patch</code>. For example, version 5.2.9 indicates major version 5, minor version 2, and patch version 9. </p>\n<p>The version number is incremented based on the level of change included in the release. </p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Major releases contain significant new features, some but minimal developer assistance is expected during the update. When updating to a new major release, you may need to run update scripts, refactor code, run additional tests, and learn new APIs. </p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Minor releases contain new smaller features. Minor releases are fully backward-compatible; no developer assistance is expected during update, but you can optionally modify your apps and libraries to begin using new APIs, features, and capabilities that were added in the release. We update peer dependencies in minor versions by expanding the supported versions, but we do not require projects to update these dependencies. </p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Patch releases are low risk, bug fix releases. No developer assistance is expected during update.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you are updating within the same major version, then you can skip any intermediate versions and update directly to the targeted version. For example, if you want to update from 5.0.0 to 5.2.9, then you can update directly; you do not need to update from 5.0.0 to 5.1.0 before updating to 5.2.9. </p>\n<p>If you are updating from one major version to another, then we recommend that you don't skip major versions. Follow the instructions to incrementally update to the next major version, testing and validating at each step. For example, if you want to update from version 4.x.x to version 6.x.x, we recommend that you update to the latest 5.x.x release first. After successfully updating to 5.x.x, you can then update to 6.x.x. </p>\n<p>Pre-release previews—such as Beta and Release Candidate versions—are indicated by appending a dash and a beta or rc identifier, such as version 5.2.9-rc.3.</p>\n<a id=\"frequency\"></a>\n<h2 id=\"release-frequency\">Release frequency<a title=\"Link to this heading\" class=\"header-link\" aria-hidden=\"true\" href=\"guide/releases#release-frequency\"><i class=\"material-icons\">link</i></a></h2>\n<p>We work toward a regular schedule of releases, so that you can plan and coordinate your updates with the continuing evolution of Angular.</p>\n<p>In general, you can expect the following release cycle:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>A major release every 6 months</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>1-3 minor releases for each major release</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>A patch release almost every week</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We bake quality into our releases—and let you preview what's coming next—by providing Beta releases and release candidates (RCs) for each major and minor release.</p>\n<p>This cadence of releases gives you access to new beta features as soon as they are ready, while maintaining the stability and reliability of the platform for production users.</p>\n<a id=\"schedule\"></a>\n<h2 id=\"release-schedule\">Release schedule<a title=\"Link to this heading\" class=\"header-link\" aria-hidden=\"true\" href=\"guide/releases#release-schedule\"><i class=\"material-icons\">link</i></a></h2>\n<div class=\"alert is-helpful\">\n<p>Disclaimer: The dates are offered as general guidance and may be adjusted by us when necessary to ensure delivery of a high-quality platform. </p>\n</div>\n<p>The following table contains our current target release dates for the next two major versions of Angular: </p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Date</th>\n<th>Stable Release</th>\n<th>Compatibility</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>September/October 2018</td>\n<td>7.0.0</td>\n<td>^6.0.0</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>March/April 2019</td>\n<td>8.0.0</td>\n<td>^7.0.0</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p> Compatibility note: The primary goal of the backward compatibility promise is to ensure that changes in the core framework and tooling don't break the existing ecosystem of components and applications and don't put undue upgrade/migration burden on Angular application and component authors.</p>\n<a id=\"lts\"></a>\n<a id=\"support\"></a>\n<h2 id=\"support-policy\">Support policy<a title=\"Link to this heading\" class=\"header-link\" aria-hidden=\"true\" href=\"guide/releases#support-policy\"><i class=\"material-icons\">link</i></a></h2>\n<p>All of our major releases are supported for 18 months. </p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>6 months of active support, during which regularly-scheduled updates and patches are released, as described above in <a href=\"guide/releases#frequency\" title=\"Release frequency\">Release frequency</a>.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>12 months of long-term support (LTS).

To prevent accidental use of private APIs—and so that you can clearly understand what is covered by the practices described here—we document what is and is not considered our public API surface.

Angular Labs provides a safe place for exploration and experimentation by the Angular team.</p>\n<p>Angular Labs projects are not ready for production use, and no commitment is made to bring them to production. The policies and practices that are described in this document do not apply to Angular Labs projects.</p>\n\n</div>\n\n<!-- links to this doc:\n - guide/updating\n-->\n<!-- links from this doc:\n - guide/releases#angular-labs\n - guide/releases#angular-versioning\n - guide/releases#angular-versioning-and-releases\n - guide/releases#deprecation-practices\n - guide/releases#frequency\n - guide/releases#public-api-surface\n - guide/releases#release-frequency\n - guide/releases#release-schedule\n - guide/releases#support-policy\n - guide/updating\n - guide/upgrade\n - https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md\n - https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/master/docs/PUBLIC_API.md\n - https://github.com/angular/angular/edit/master/aio/content/guide/releases.md?message=docs%3A%20describe%20your%20change...\n - https://semver.org/\n-->"
