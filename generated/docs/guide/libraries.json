For example, to add <a href=\"guide/reactive-forms\">reactive forms</a> to an app, add the library package using <code>ng add @angular/forms</code>, then import the <code><a href=\"api/forms/ReactiveFormsModule\" class=\"code-anchor\">ReactiveFormsModule</a></code> from the <code>@angular/forms</code> library in your application code.\nSimilarly, adding the <a href=\"guide/service-worker-intro\">service worker</a> library to an Angular application is one of the steps for turning an application into a <a href=\"https://developers.google.com/web/progressive-web-apps/\">Progressive Web App</a> (PWA).\n<a href=\"https://material.angular.io/\">Angular Material</a> is an example of a large, general-purpose library that provides sophisticated, reusable, and adaptable UI components.</p>\n<p>Any app developer can use these and other libraries that have been published as npm packages by the Angular team or by third parties. See <a href=\"guide/using-libraries\">Using Published Libraries</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"creating-libraries\">Creating libraries<a title=\"Link to this heading\" class=\"header-link\" aria-hidden=\"true\" href=\"guide/libraries#creating-libraries\"><i class=\"material-icons\">link</i></a></h2>\n<p>If you have developed functionality that is suitable for reuse, you can create your own libraries.\nThese libraries can be used locally in your workspace, or you can publish them as <a href=\"guide/npm-packages\">npm packages</a> to share with other projects or other Angular developers.\nThese packages can be published to the npm registry, a private npm Enterprise registry, or a private package management system that supports npm packages.\nSee <a href=\"guide/creating-libraries\">Creating Libraries</a>.</p>\n<p>Whether you decide to package functionality as a library is an architectural decision, similar to deciding whether a piece of functionality is a component or a service, or deciding on the scope of a component.</p>\n<p>Packaging functionality as a library forces the artifacts in the library to be decoupled from the application's business logic.\nThis can help to avoid various bad practices or architecture mistakes that can make it difficult to decouple and reuse code in the future.</p>\n<p>Putting code into a separate library is more complex than simply putting everything in one app.\nIt requires more of an investment in time and thought for managing, maintaining, and updating the library.\nThis complexity can pay off, however, when the library is being used in multiple apps.</p>\n\n</div>\n\n<!-- links to this doc:\n-->\n<!-- links from this doc:\n - api/forms/ReactiveFormsModule\n - guide/creating-libraries\n - guide/glossary#project\n - guide/libraries#creating-libraries\n - guide/libraries#overview-of-angular-libraries\n - guide/npm-packages\n - guide/reactive-forms\n - guide/service-worker-intro\n - guide/using-libraries\n - https://developers.google.com/web/progressive-web-apps/\n - https://github.com/angular/angular/edit/master/aio/content/guide/libraries.md?message=docs%3A%20describe%20your%20change...\n - https://material.angular.io/\n-->"
