In this case, you may want to consult the <a href=\"guide/updating-to-version-10\">general version 10 guide</a>. If you've opted into any of the new, stricter type-checking settings, you may also want to check out the <a href=\"guide/template-typecheck\">template type-checking guide</a>.</p>\n<p>If the errors are gone, switch back to Ivy by removing the changes to the <code>tsconfig.json</code> and review the list of expected changes below.</p>\n<a id=\"payload-size-debugging\"></a>\n<h3 id=\"payload-size-debugging\">Payload size debugging<a title=\"Link to this heading\" class=\"header-link\" aria-hidden=\"true\" href=\"guide/ivy-compatibility#payload-size-debugging\"><i class=\"material-icons\">link</i></a></h3>\n<p>If you notice that the size of your application's main bundle has increased with Ivy, you may want to check the following:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Verify that the components and <code>NgModules</code> that you want to be lazy loaded are only imported in lazy modules.\nAnything that you import outside lazy modules can end up in the main bundle.\nSee more details in the original issue <a href=\"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/16146#issuecomment-557559287\">here</a>.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Check that imported libraries have been marked side-effect-free.\nIf your app imports from shared libraries that are meant to be free from side effects, add \"sideEffects\": false to their <code>package.json</code>.\nThis will ensure that the libraries will be properly tree-shaken if they are imported but not directly referenced.\nSee more details in the original issue <a href=\"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/16799#issuecomment-580912090\">here</a>.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Projects not using Angular CLI will see a significant size regression unless they update their minifier settings and set compile-time constants <code>ngDevMode</code>, <code>ngI18nClosureMode</code> and <code>ngJitMode</code> to <code>false</code> (for Terser, please set these to <code>false</code> via <a href=\"https://terser.org/docs/api-reference.html#conditional-compilation\"><code>global_defs</code> config option</a>).\nPlease note that these constants are not meant to be used by 3rd party library or application code as they are not part of our public api surface and might change in the future.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<a id=\"common-changes\"></a>\n<h3 id=\"changes-you-may-see\">Changes you may see<a title=\"Link to this heading\" class=\"header-link\" aria-hidden=\"true\" href=\"guide/ivy-compatibility#changes-you-may-see\"><i class=\"material-icons\">link</i></a></h3>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>By default, <code>@<a href=\"api/core/ContentChildren\" class=\"code-anchor\">ContentChildren</a></code> queries will only search direct child nodes in the DOM hierarchy (previously, they would search any nesting level in the DOM as long as another directive wasn't matched above it). See further <a href=\"guide/ivy-compatibility-examples#content-children-descendants\">details</a>.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>All classes that use Angular DI must have an Angular decorator like <code>@<a href=\"api/core/Directive\" class=\"code-anchor\">Directive</a>()</code> or <code>@<a href=\"api/core/Injectable\" class=\"code-anchor\">Injectable</a></code> (previously, undecorated classes were allowed in AOT mode only or if injection flags were used).

This primarily affects tests that do identity comparison of these objects.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>ICU parsing happens at runtime, so only text, HTML tags and text bindings are allowed inside ICU cases (previously, directives were also permitted inside ICUs).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Adding text bindings into i18n translations that are not present in the source template itself will throw a runtime error (previously, including extra bindings in translations was permitted).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Extra HTML tags in i18n translations that are not present in the source template itself will be rendered as plain text (previously, these tags would render as HTML).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Providers formatted as <code>{provide: X}</code> without a <code>useValue</code>, <code>useFactory</code>, <code>useExisting</code>, or <code>useClass</code> property are treated like <code>{provide: X, useClass: X}</code> (previously, it defaulted to <code>{provide: X, useValue: undefined}</code>).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><code><a href=\"api/core/DebugElement#attributes\" class=\"code-anchor\">DebugElement.attributes</a></code> returns <code>undefined</code> for attributes that were added and then subsequently removed (previously, attributes added and later removed would have a value of <code>null</code>).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><code><a href=\"api/core/DebugElement#classes\" class=\"code-anchor\">DebugElement.classes</a></code> returns <code>undefined</code> for classes that were added and then subsequently removed (previously, classes added and later removed would have a value of <code>false</code>).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>If selecting the native <code>&#x3C;option></code> element in a <code>&#x3C;select></code> where the <code>&#x3C;option></code>s are created via <code>*<a href=\"api/common/NgForOf\" class=\"code-anchor\">ngFor</a></code>, use the <code>[selected]</code> property of an <code>&#x3C;option></code> instead of binding to the <code>[value]</code> property of the <code>&#x3C;select></code> element (previously, you could bind to either.) <a href=\"guide/ivy-compatibility-examples#select-value-binding\">details</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Embedded views (such as ones created by <code>*<a href=\"api/common/NgForOf\" class=\"code-anchor\">ngFor</a></code>) are now inserted in front of anchor DOM comment node (e.g. <code>&#x3C;!--ng-for-of--></code>) rather than behind it as was the case previously.\nIn most cases this does not have any impact on rendered DOM.\nIn some cases (such as animations delaying the removal of an embedded view) any new embedded views will be inserted after the embedded view being animated away.\nThis difference only last while the animation is active, and might alter the visual appearance of the animation.\nOnce the animation is finished the resulting rendered DOM is identical to that rendered with View Engine.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n\n</div>\n\n<!-- links to this doc:\n - guide/ivy\n - guide/updating-to-version-10\n-->\n<!-- links from this doc:\n - api/common/NgForOf\n - api/core/Component\n - api/core/ContentChild\n - api/core/ContentChildren\n - api/core/DebugElement#attributes\n - api/core/DebugElement#classes\n - api/core/Directive\n - api/core/Host\n - api/core/HostBinding\n - api/core/Injectable\n - api/core/NgModule\n - api/core/Self\n - api/core/TemplateRef\n - api/core/ViewContainerRef\n - api/platform-browser/HammerModule\n - guide/ivy#opting-out-of-angular-ivy\n - guide/ivy-compatibility#changes-you-may-see\n - guide/ivy-compatibility#how-to-debug-errors-with-ivy\n - guide/ivy-compatibility#ivy-compatibility-guide\n - guide/ivy-compatibility#less-common-changes\n - guide/ivy-compatibility#payload-size-debugging\n - guide/ivy-compatibility-examples#content-children-descendants\n - guide/ivy-compatibility-examples#forward-refs-directive-inputs\n - guide/ivy-compatibility-examples#select-value-binding\n - guide/ivy-compatibility-examples#undecorated-classes\n - guide/template-typecheck\n - guide/updating-to-version-10\n - guide/updating-to-version-10#breaking-changes\n - guide/updating-to-version-10#migrations\n - guide/updating-to-version-10#removals\n - https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/16146#issuecomment-557559287\n - https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/16799#issuecomment-580912090\n - https://github.com/angular/angular/edit/master/aio/content/guide/ivy-compatibility.md?message=docs%3A%20describe%20your%20change...\n - https://terser.org/docs/api-reference.html#conditional-compilation\n-->"
