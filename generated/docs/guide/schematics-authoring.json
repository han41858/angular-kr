The <code>Tree</code> data structure contains a <em>base</em> (a set of files that already exists) and a <em>staging area</em> (a list of changes to be applied to the base).\nWhen making modifications, you don't actually change the base, but add those modifications to the staging area.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>A <code>Rule</code> object defines a function that takes a <code>Tree</code>, applies transformations, and returns a new <code>Tree</code>. The main file for a schematic, <code>index.ts</code>, defines a set of rules that implement the schematic's logic.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>A transformation is represented by an <code>Action</code>. There are four action types: <code><a href=\"\" class=\"code-anchor\">Create</a></code>, <code>Rename</code>, <code>Overwrite</code>, and <code>Delete</code>.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Each schematic runs in a context, represented by a <code>SchematicContext</code> object.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The context object passed into a rule provides access to utility functions and metadata that the schematic may need to work with, including a logging API to help with debugging.\nThe context also defines a <em>merge strategy</em> that determines how changes are merged from the staged tree into the base tree. A change can be accepted or ignored, or throw an exception.</p>\n<h3 id=\"defining-rules-and-actions\">Defining rules and actions<a title=\"Link to this heading\" class=\"header-link\" aria-hidden=\"true\" href=\"guide/schematics-authoring#defining-rules-and-actions\"><i class=\"material-icons\">link</i></a></h3>\n<p>When you create a new blank schematic with the <a href=\"guide/schematics-authoring#cli\">Schematics CLI</a>, the generated entry function is a <em>rule factory</em>.\nA <code>RuleFactory</code>object defines a higher-order function that creates a <code>Rule</code>.</p>\n<code-example language=\"TypeScript\" linenums=\"false\">\nimport { Rule, SchematicContext, Tree } from '@angular-devkit/schematics';\n\n// You don't have to export the function as default.\n// You can also have more than one rule factory per file.\nexport function helloWorld(_options: any): Rule {\n return (tree: Tree, _context: SchematicContext) => {\n   return tree;\n };\n}\n</code-example>\n<p>Your rules can make changes to your projects by calling external tools and implementing logic.\nYou need a rule, for example, to define how a template in the schematic is to be merged into the hosting project.</p>\n<p>Rules can make use of utilities provided with the <code>@schematics/angular</code> package. Look for helper functions for working with modules, dependencies, TypeScript, AST, JSON, Angular CLI workspaces and projects, and more.</p>\n<code-example language=\"none\" linenums=\"false\">\n\nimport {\n  JsonAstObject,\n  JsonObject,\n  JsonValue,\n  Path,\n  normalize,\n  parseJsonAst,\n  strings,\n} from '@angular-devkit/core';\n\n</code-example>\n<h3 id=\"defining-input-options-with-a-schema-and-interfaces\">Defining input options with a schema and interfaces<a title=\"Link to this heading\" class=\"header-link\" aria-hidden=\"true\" href=\"guide/schematics-authoring#defining-input-options-with-a-schema-and-interfaces\"><i class=\"material-icons\">link</i></a></h3>\n<p>Rules can collect option values from the caller and inject them into templates.\nThe options available to your rules, with their allowed values and defaults, are defined in the schematic's JSON schema file, <code>&#x3C;schematic>/schema.json</code>.\nYou can define variable or enumerated data types for the schema using TypeScript interfaces.</p>\n<p>You can see examples of schema files for the Angular CLI command schematics in <a href=\"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/7.0.x/packages/schematics/angular/application/schema.json\"><code>@schematics/angular</code></a>.</p>\n<a id=\"cli\"></a>\n<h2 id=\"schematics-cli\">Schematics CLI<a title=\"Link to this heading\" class=\"header-link\" aria-hidden=\"true\" href=\"guide/schematics-authoring#schematics-cli\"><i class=\"material-icons\">link</i></a></h2>\n<p>Schematics come with their own command-line tool.\nUsing Node 6.9 or above, install the Schematics command line tool globally:</p>\n<code-example language=\"bash\" linenums=\"false\">\nnpm install -g @angular-devkit/schematics-cli\n</code-example>\n<p>This installs the <code>schematics</code> executable, which you can use to create a new schematics collection in its own project folder, add a new schematic to an existing collection, or extend an existing schematic.</p>\n<p>In the following sections, we will create a new schematics collection using the CLI in order to introduce the files and file structure, and some of the basic concepts.</p>\n<p>The most common use of schematics, however, is to integrate an Angular library with the Angular CLI.\nYou can do this by creating the schematic files directly within the library project in an Angular workspace, without using the Schematics CLI.\nSee <a href=\"guide/schematics-for-libraries\">Schematics for Libraries</a>.</p>\n<h3 id=\"creating-a-schematics-collection\">Creating a schematics collection<a title=\"Link to this heading\" class=\"header-link\" aria-hidden=\"true\" href=\"guide/schematics-authoring#creating-a-schematics-collection\"><i class=\"material-icons\">link</i></a></h3>\n<p>The following command creates a new schematic named <code>hello-world</code> in a new project folder of the same name.</p>\n<code-example language=\"bash\" linenums=\"false\">\nschematics blank --name=hello-world\n</code-example>\n<p>The <code>blank</code> schematic is provided by the Schematics CLI. The command creates a new project folder (the root folder for the collection) and an initial named schematic in the collection.</p>\n<p>Go to the collection folder, install your npm dependencies, and open your new collection in your favorite editor to see the generated files. For example, if you are using VSCode:</p>\n<code-example language=\"bash\" linenums=\"false\">\ncd hello-world\nnpm install\nnpm run build\ncode .\n</code-example>\n<p>The initial schematic gets the same name as the project folder, and is generated in <code>src/hello-world</code>.\nYou can add related schematics to this collection, and modify the generated skeleton code to define your schematic's functionality.\nEach schematic name must be unique within the collection.</p>\n<h3 id=\"running-a-schematic\">Running a schematic<a title=\"Link to this heading\" class=\"header-link\" aria-hidden=\"true\" href=\"guide/schematics-authoring#running-a-schematic\"><i class=\"material-icons\">link</i></a></h3>\n<p>Use the <code>schematics</code> command to run a named schematic.\nProvide the path to the project folder, the schematic name, and any mandatory options, in the following format.</p>\n<code-example language=\"bash\" linenums=\"false\">\nschematics &#x3C;path-to-schematics-project>:&#x3C;schematics-name> --&#x3C;required-option>=&#x3C;value>\n</code-example>\n<p>The path can be absolute or relative to the current working directory where the command is executed.\nFor example, to run the schematic we just generated (which has no required options), use the following command.</p>\n<code-example language=\"bash\" linenums=\"false\">\nschematics .:hello-world\n</code-example>\n<h3 id=\"adding-a-schematic-to-a-collection\">Adding a schematic to a collection<a title=\"Link to this heading\" class=\"header-link\" aria-hidden=\"true\" href=\"guide/schematics-authoring#adding-a-schematic-to-a-collection\"><i class=\"material-icons\">link</i></a></h3>\n<p>To add a schematic to an existing collection, use the same command you use to start a new schematics project, but run the command inside the project folder.</p>\n<code-example language=\"bash\" linenums=\"false\">\ncd hello-world\nschematics blank --name=goodbye-world\n</code-example>\n<p>The command generates the new named schematic inside your collection, with a main <code>index.ts</code> file and its associated test spec.\nIt also adds the name, description, and factory function for the new schematic to the collection's schema in the <code>collection.json</code> file.</p>\n<h2 id=\"collection-contents\">Collection contents<a title=\"Link to this heading\" class=\"header-link\" aria-hidden=\"true\" href=\"guide/schematics-authoring#collection-contents\"><i class=\"material-icons\">link</i></a></h2>\n<p>The top level of the root project folder for a collection contains configuration files, a <code>node_modules</code> folder, and a <code>src/</code> folder.\nThe <code>src/</code> folder contains subfolders for named schematics in the collection, and a schema, <code>collection.json</code>, which describes the collected schematics.\nEach schematic is created with a name, description, and factory function.</p>\n<code-example language=\"none\" linenums=\"false\">\n{\n  \"$schema\":\n     \"../node_modules/@angular-devkit/schematics/collection-schema.json\",\n  \"schematics\": {\n    \"hello-world\": {\n      \"description\": \"A blank schematic.\",\n      \"factory\": \"./hello-world/index#helloWorld\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n</code-example>\n<ul>\n<li>The <code>$schema</code> property specifies the schema that the CLI uses for validation.</li>\n<li>The <code>schematics</code> property lists named schematics that belong to this collection.\nEach schematic has a plain-text description, and points to the generated entry function in the main file.</li>\n<li>The <code>factory</code> property points to the generated entry function.
