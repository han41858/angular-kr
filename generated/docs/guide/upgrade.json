It is possible to\nprepare and align AngularJS applications with Angular even before beginning\nthe upgrade process. These preparation steps are all about making the code\nmore decoupled, more maintainable, and better aligned with modern development\ntools. That means in addition to making the upgrade easier,\nyou will also improve the existing AngularJS applications.</p>\n<p>One of the keys to a successful upgrade is to do it incrementally,\nby running the two frameworks side by side in the same application, and\nporting AngularJS components to Angular one by one. This makes it possible\nto upgrade even large and complex applications without disrupting other\nbusiness, because the work can be done collaboratively and spread over\na period of time. The <code>upgrade</code> module in Angular has been designed to\nmake incremental upgrading seamless.</p>\n<h2 id=\"preparation\">Preparation<a title=\"Link to this heading\" class=\"header-link\" aria-hidden=\"true\" href=\"guide/upgrade#preparation\"><i class=\"material-icons\">link</i></a></h2>\n<p>There are many ways to structure AngularJS applications. When you begin\nto upgrade these applications to Angular, some will turn out to be\nmuch more easy to work with than others. There are a few key techniques\nand patterns that you can apply to future proof apps even before you\nbegin the migration.</p>\n<a id=\"follow-the-angular-styleguide\"></a>\n<h3 id=\"follow-the-angularjs-style-guide\">Follow the AngularJS Style Guide<a title=\"Link to this heading\" class=\"header-link\" aria-hidden=\"true\" href=\"guide/upgrade#follow-the-angularjs-style-guide\"><i class=\"material-icons\">link</i></a></h3>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://github.com/johnpapa/angular-styleguide/blob/master/a1/README.md\">AngularJS Style Guide</a>\ncollects patterns and practices that have been proven to result in\ncleaner and more maintainable AngularJS applications. It contains a wealth\nof information about how to write and organize AngularJS code - and equally\nimportantly - how <strong>not</strong> to write and organize AngularJS code.</p>\n<p>Angular is a reimagined version of the best parts of AngularJS. In that\nsense, its goals are the same as the AngularJS Style Guide's: To preserve\nthe good parts of AngularJS, and to avoid the bad parts. There's a lot\nmore to Angular than just that of course, but this does mean that\n<em>following the style guide helps make your AngularJS app more closely\naligned with Angular</em>.</p>\n<p>There are a few rules in particular that will make it much easier to do\n<em>an incremental upgrade</em> using the Angular <code><a href=\"api/upgrade/static\" class=\"code-anchor\">upgrade/static</a></code> module:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://github.com/johnpapa/angular-styleguide/blob/master/a1/README.md#single-responsibility\">Rule of 1</a>\nstates that there should be one component per file. This not only makes\ncomponents easy to navigate and find, but will also allow us to migrate\nthem between languages and frameworks one at a time. In this example application,\neach controller, component, service, and filter is in its own source file.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://github.com/johnpapa/angular-styleguide/blob/master/a1/README.md#folders-by-feature-structure\">Folders-by-Feature Structure</a>\nand <a href=\"https://github.com/johnpapa/angular-styleguide/blob/master/a1/README.md#modularity\">Modularity</a>\nrules define similar principles on a higher level of abstraction: Different parts of the\napplication should reside in different directories and NgModules.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>When an application is laid out feature per feature in this way, it can also be\nmigrated one feature at a time. For applications that don't already look like\nthis, applying the rules in the AngularJS style guide is a highly recommended\npreparation step. And this is not just for the sake of the upgrade - it is just\nsolid advice in general!</p>\n<h3 id=\"using-a-module-loader\">Using a Module Loader<a title=\"Link to this heading\" class=\"header-link\" aria-hidden=\"true\" href=\"guide/upgrade#using-a-module-loader\"><i class=\"material-icons\">link</i></a></h3>\n<p>When you break application code down into one component per file, you often end\nup with a project structure with a large number of relatively small files. This is\na much neater way to organize things than a small number of large files, but it\ndoesn't work that well if you have to load all those files to the HTML page with\n&#x3C;script> tags. Especially when you also have to maintain those tags in the correct\norder. That's why it's a good idea to start using a <em>module loader</em>.</p>\n<p>Using a module loader such as <a href=\"https://github.com/systemjs/systemjs\">SystemJS</a>,\n<a href=\"http://webpack.github.io/\">Webpack</a>, or <a href=\"http://browserify.org/\">Browserify</a>\nallows us to use the built-in module systems of TypeScript or ES2015.\nYou can use the <code>import</code> and <code>export</code> features that explicitly specify what code can\nand will be shared between different parts of the application. For ES5 applications\nyou can use CommonJS style <code>require</code> and <code>module.exports</code> features. In both cases,\nthe module loader will then take care of loading all the code the application needs\nin the correct order.</p>\n<p>When moving applications into production, module loaders also make it easier\nto package them all up into production bundles with batteries included.</p>\n<h3 id=\"migrating-to-typescript\">Migrating to TypeScript<a title=\"Link to this heading\" class=\"header-link\" aria-hidden=\"true\" href=\"guide/upgrade#migrating-to-typescript\"><i class=\"material-icons\">link</i></a></h3>\n<p>If part of the Angular upgrade plan is to also take TypeScript into use, it makes\nsense to bring in the TypeScript compiler even before the upgrade itself begins.\nThis means there's one less thing to learn and think about during the actual upgrade.\nIt also means you can start using TypeScript features in your AngularJS code.</p>\n<p>Since TypeScript is a superset of ECMAScript 2015, which in turn is a superset\nof ECMAScript 5, \"switching\" to TypeScript doesn't necessarily require anything\nmore than installing the TypeScript compiler and renaming files from\n<code>*.js</code> to <code>*.ts</code>. But just doing that is not hugely useful or exciting, of course.\nAdditional steps like the following can give us much more bang for the buck:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>For applications that use a module loader, TypeScript imports and exports\n(which are really ECMAScript 2015 imports and exports) can be used to organize\ncode into modules.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Type annotations can be gradually added to existing functions and variables\nto pin down their types and get benefits like build-time error checking,\ngreat autocompletion support and inline documentation.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>JavaScript features new to ES2015, like arrow functions, <code>let</code>s and <code>const</code>s,\ndefault function parameters, and destructuring assignments can also be gradually\nadded to make the code more expressive.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Services and controllers can be turned into <em>classes</em>. That way they'll be a step\ncloser to becoming Angular service and component classes, which will make\nlife easier after the upgrade.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"using-component-directives\">Using Component Directives<a title=\"Link to this heading\" class=\"header-link\" aria-hidden=\"true\" href=\"guide/upgrade#using-component-directives\"><i class=\"material-icons\">link</i></a></h3>\n<p>In Angular, components are the main primitive from which user interfaces\nare built. You define the different portions of the UI as components and\ncompose them into a full user experience.</p>\n<p>You can also do this in AngularJS, using <em>component directives</em>. These are\ndirectives that define their own templates, controllers, and input/output bindings -\nthe same things that Angular components define. Applications built with\ncomponent directives are much easier to migrate to Angular than applications\nbuilt with lower-level features like <code>ng-controller</code>,  <code>ng-include</code>, and scope\ninheritance.</p>\n<p>To be Angular compatible, an AngularJS component directive should configure\nthese attributes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>restrict: 'E'</code>. Components are usually used as elements.</li>\n<li><code><a href=\"api/service-worker/SwRegistrationOptions#scope\" class=\"code-anchor\">scope</a>: {}</code> - an isolate scope. In Angular, components are always isolated\nfrom their surroundings, and you should do this in AngularJS too.</li>\n<li><code>bindToController: {}</code>. Component inputs and outputs should be bound\nto the controller instead of using the <code>$<a href=\"api/service-worker/SwRegistrationOptions#scope\" class=\"code-anchor\">scope</a></code>.</li>\n<li><code>controller</code> and <code>controllerAs</code>. Components have their own controllers.</li>\n<li><code>template</code> or <code><a href=\"api/core/Component#templateUrl\" class=\"code-anchor\">templateUrl</a></code>. Components have their own templates.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Component directives may also use the following attributes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>transclude: true/{}</code>, if the component needs to transclude content from elsewhere.</li>\n<li><code>require</code>, if the component needs to communicate with some parent component's\ncontroller.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Component directives <strong>should not</strong> use the following attributes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>compile</code>. This will not be supported in Angular.</li>\n<li><code>replace: true</code>. Angular never replaces a component element with the\ncomponent template. This attribute is also deprecated in AngularJS.</li>\n<li><code>priority</code> and <code>terminal</code>. While AngularJS components may use these,\nthey are not used in Angular and it is better not to write code\nthat relies on them.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>An AngularJS component directive that is fully aligned with the Angular\narchitecture may look something like this:</p>\n<code-example path=\"upgrade-module/src/app/hero-detail.directive.ts\" header=\"hero-detail.directive.ts\">\nexport function heroDetailDirective() {\n  return {\n    restrict: 'E',\n    <a href=\"api/service-worker/SwRegistrationOptions#scope\" class=\"code-anchor\">scope</a>: {},\n    bindToController: {\n      hero: '=',\n      deleted: '&#x26;'\n    },\n    template: `\n      &#x3C;h2>{{$ctrl.hero.name}} details!&#x3C;/h2>\n      &#x3C;div>&#x3C;label>id: &#x3C;/label>{{$ctrl.hero.id}}&#x3C;/div>\n      &#x3C;button ng-click=\"$ctrl.onDelete()\">Delete&#x3C;/button>\n    `,\n    controller: function() {\n      this.onDelete = () => {\n        this.deleted({hero: this.hero});\n      };\n    },\n    controllerAs: '$ctrl'\n  };\n}\n\n\n</code-example>\n<p>AngularJS 1.5 introduces the <a href=\"https://docs.angularjs.org/api/ng/type/angular.Module#component\">component API</a>\nthat makes it easier to define component directives like these. It is a good idea to use\nthis API for component directives for several reasons:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>It requires less boilerplate code.</li>\n<li>It enforces the use of component best practices like <code>controllerAs</code>.</li>\n<li>It has good default values for directive attributes like <code><a href=\"api/service-worker/SwRegistrationOptions#scope\" class=\"code-anchor\">scope</a></code> and <code>restrict</code>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The component directive example from above looks like this when expressed\nusing the component API:</p>\n<code-example path=\"upgrade-module/src/app/upgrade-io/hero-detail.component.ts\" region=\"hero-detail-io\" header=\"hero-detail.component.ts\">\nexport const heroDetail = {\n  bindings: {\n    hero: '&#x3C;',\n    deleted: '&#x26;'\n  },\n  template: `\n    &#x3C;h2>{{$ctrl.hero.name}} details!&#x3C;/h2>\n    &#x3C;div>&#x3C;label>id: &#x3C;/label>{{$ctrl.hero.id}}&#x3C;/div>\n    &#x3C;button ng-click=\"$ctrl.onDelete()\">Delete&#x3C;/button>\n  `,\n  controller: function() {\n    this.onDelete = () => {\n      this.deleted(this.hero);\n    };\n  }\n};\n\n</code-example>\n<p>Controller lifecycle hook methods <code>$<a href=\"\" class=\"code-anchor\">onInit</a>()</code>, <code>$onDestroy()</code>, and <code>$<a href=\"\" class=\"code-anchor\">onChanges</a>()</code>\nare another convenient feature that AngularJS 1.5 introduces. They all have nearly\nexact <a href=\"guide/lifecycle-hooks\">equivalents in Angular</a>, so organizing component lifecycle\nlogic around them will ease the eventual Angular upgrade process.</p>\n<h2 id=\"upgrading-with-ngupgrade\">Upgrading with ngUpgrade<a title=\"Link to this heading\" class=\"header-link\" aria-hidden=\"true\" href=\"guide/upgrade#upgrading-with-ngupgrade\"><i class=\"material-icons\">link</i></a></h2>\n<p>The ngUpgrade library in Angular is a very useful tool for upgrading\nanything but the smallest of applications. With it you can mix and match\nAngularJS and Angular components in the same application and have them interoperate\nseamlessly. That means you don't have to do the upgrade work all at once,\nsince there's a natural coexistence between the two frameworks during the\ntransition period.</p>\n<h3 id=\"how-ngupgrade-works\">How ngUpgrade Works<a title=\"Link to this heading\" class=\"header-link\" aria-hidden=\"true\" href=\"guide/upgrade#how-ngupgrade-works\"><i class=\"material-icons\">link</i></a></h3>\n<p>One of the primary tools provided by ngUpgrade is called the <code><a href=\"api/upgrade/static/UpgradeModule\" class=\"code-anchor\">UpgradeModule</a></code>.\nThis is a module that contains utilities for bootstrapping and managing hybrid\napplications that support both Angular and AngularJS code.</p>\n<p>When you use ngUpgrade, what you're really doing is <em>running both AngularJS and\nAngular at the same time</em>. All Angular code is running in the Angular\nframework, and AngularJS code in the AngularJS framework. Both of these are the\nactual, fully featured versions of the frameworks. There is no emulation going on,\nso you can expect to have all the features and natural behavior of both frameworks.</p>\n<p>What happens on top of this is that components and services managed by one\nframework can interoperate with those from the other framework. This happens\nin three main areas: Dependency injection, the DOM, and change detection.</p>\n<h4 id=\"dependency-injection\">Dependency Injection<a title=\"Link to this heading\" class=\"header-link\" aria-hidden=\"true\" href=\"guide/upgrade#dependency-injection\"><i class=\"material-icons\">link</i></a></h4>\n<p>Dependency injection is front and center in both AngularJS and\nAngular, but there are some key differences between the two\nframeworks in how it actually works.</p>\n<table>\n  <tbody><tr>\n    <th>\n      AngularJS\n    </th>\n    <th>\n      Angular\n    </th>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>\n      Dependency injection tokens are always strings\n    </td>\n    <td>\n<p>      Tokens <a href=\"guide/dependency-injection\">can have different types</a>.\nThey are often classes. They may also be strings.</p>\n    </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>\n<p>      There is exactly one injector. Even in multi-module applications,\neverything is poured into one big namespace.</p>\n    </td>\n    <td>\n<p>      There is a <a href=\"guide/hierarchical-dependency-injection\">tree hierarchy of injectors</a>,\nwith a root injector and an additional injector for each component.</p>\n    </td>\n  </tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p>Even accounting for these differences you can still have dependency injection\ninteroperability. <code><a href=\"api/upgrade/static\" class=\"code-anchor\">upgrade/static</a></code> resolves the differences and makes\neverything work seamlessly:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>You can make AngularJS services available for injection to Angular code\nby <em>upgrading</em> them. The same singleton instance of each service is shared\nbetween the frameworks. In Angular these services will always be in the\n<em>root injector</em> and available to all components.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>You can also make Angular services available for injection to AngularJS code\nby <em>downgrading</em> them. Only services from the Angular root injector can\nbe downgraded. Again, the same singleton instances are shared between the frameworks.\nWhen you register a downgraded service, you must explicitly specify a <em>string token</em> that you want to\nuse in AngularJS.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<div class=\"lightbox\">\n  <img src=\"generated/images/guide/upgrade/injectors.png\" alt=\"The two injectors in a hybrid application\" width=\"700\" height=\"262\">\n</div>\n<h4 id=\"components-and-the-dom\">Components and the DOM<a title=\"Link to this heading\" class=\"header-link\" aria-hidden=\"true\" href=\"guide/upgrade#components-and-the-dom\"><i class=\"material-icons\">link</i></a></h4>\n<p>In the DOM of a hybrid ngUpgrade application are components and\ndirectives from both AngularJS and Angular. These components\ncommunicate with each other by using the input and output bindings\nof their respective frameworks, which ngUpgrade bridges together. They may also\ncommunicate through shared injected dependencies, as described above.</p>\n<p>The key thing to understand about a hybrid application is that every element in the DOM is owned by exactly one of the two frameworks.\nThe other framework ignores it. If an element is\nowned by AngularJS, Angular treats it as if it didn't exist,\nand vice versa.</p>\n<p>So normally a hybrid application begins life as an AngularJS application,\nand it is AngularJS that processes the root template, e.g. the index.html.\nAngular then steps into the picture when an Angular component is used somewhere\nin an AngularJS template. That component's template will then be managed\nby Angular, and it may contain any number of Angular components and\ndirectives.</p>\n<p>Beyond that, you may interleave the two frameworks.\nYou always cross the boundary between the two frameworks by one of two\nways:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>By using a component from the other framework: An AngularJS template\nusing an Angular component, or an Angular template using an\nAngularJS component.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>By transcluding or projecting content from the other framework. ngUpgrade\nbridges the related concepts of AngularJS transclusion and Angular content\nprojection together.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<div class=\"lightbox\">\n  <img src=\"generated/images/guide/upgrade/dom.png\" alt=\"DOM element ownership in a hybrid application\" width=\"500\" height=\"294\">\n</div>\n<p>Whenever you use a component that belongs to the other framework, a\nswitch between framework boundaries occurs. However, that switch only\nhappens to the elements in the template of that component. Consider a situation\nwhere you use an Angular component from AngularJS like this:</p>\n<code-example language=\"html\" escape=\"html\">\n  &#x3C;a-component>&#x3C;/a-component>\n</code-example>\n<p>The DOM element <code>&#x3C;a-component></code> will remain to be an AngularJS managed\nelement, because it's defined in an AngularJS template. That also\nmeans you can apply additional AngularJS directives to it, but <em>not</em>\nAngular directives. It is only in the template of the <code>&#x3C;a-component></code>\nwhere Angular steps in. This same rule also applies when you\nuse AngularJS component directives from Angular.</p>\n<h4 id=\"change-detection\">Change Detection<a title=\"Link to this heading\" class=\"header-link\" aria-hidden=\"true\" href=\"guide/upgrade#change-detection\"><i class=\"material-icons\">link</i></a></h4>\n<p>The <code>scope.$apply()</code> is how AngularJS detects changes and updates data bindings.\nAfter every event that occurs, <code>scope.$apply()</code> gets called. This is done either\nautomatically by the framework, or manually by you.</p>\n<p>In Angular things are different. While change detection still\noccurs after every event, no one needs to call <code>scope.$apply()</code> for\nthat to happen. This is because all Angular code runs inside something\ncalled the <a href=\"api/core/NgZone\">Angular zone</a>. Angular always\nknows when the code finishes, so it also knows when it should kick off\nchange detection. The code itself doesn't have to call <code>scope.$apply()</code>\nor anything like it.</p>\n<p>In the case of hybrid applications, the <code><a href=\"api/upgrade/static/UpgradeModule\" class=\"code-anchor\">UpgradeModule</a></code> bridges the\nAngularJS and Angular approaches. Here's what happens:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Everything that happens in the application runs inside the Angular zone.\nThis is true whether the event originated in AngularJS or Angular code.\nThe zone triggers Angular change detection after every event.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The <code><a href=\"api/upgrade/static/UpgradeModule\" class=\"code-anchor\">UpgradeModule</a></code> will invoke the AngularJS <code>$rootScope.$apply()</code> after\nevery turn of the Angular zone. This also triggers AngularJS change\ndetection after every event.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<div class=\"lightbox\">\n  <img src=\"generated/images/guide/upgrade/change_detection.png\" alt=\"Change detection in a hybrid application\" width=\"600\" height=\"163\">\n</div>\n<p>In practice, you do not need to call <code>$apply()</code>,\nregardless of whether it is in AngularJS or Angular. The\n<code><a href=\"api/upgrade/static/UpgradeModule\" class=\"code-anchor\">UpgradeModule</a></code> does it for us. You <em>can</em> still call <code>$apply()</code> so there\nis no need to remove such calls from existing code. Those calls just trigger\nadditional AngularJS change detection checks in a hybrid application.</p>\n<p>When you downgrade an Angular component and then use it from AngularJS,\nthe component's inputs will be watched using AngularJS change detection.\nWhen those inputs change, the corresponding properties in the component\nare set. You can also hook into the changes by implementing the\n<a href=\"api/core/OnChanges\">OnChanges</a> interface in the component,\njust like you could if it hadn't been downgraded.</p>\n<p>Correspondingly, when you upgrade an AngularJS component and use it from Angular,\nall the bindings defined for the component directive's <code><a href=\"api/service-worker/SwRegistrationOptions#scope\" class=\"code-anchor\">scope</a></code> (or <code>bindToController</code>)\nwill be hooked into Angular change detection. They will be treated\nas regular Angular inputs. Their values will be written to the upgraded component's\nscope (or controller) when they change.</p>\n<h3 id=\"using-upgrademodule-with-angular-ngmodules\">Using UpgradeModule with Angular <em>NgModules</em><a title=\"Link to this heading\" class=\"header-link\" aria-hidden=\"true\" href=\"guide/upgrade#using-upgrademodule-with-angular-ngmodules\"><i class=\"material-icons\">link</i></a></h3>\n<p>Both AngularJS and Angular have their own concept of modules\nto help organize an application into cohesive blocks of functionality.</p>\n<p>Their details are quite different in architecture and implementation.\nIn AngularJS, you add Angular assets to the <code>angular.module</code> property.\nIn Angular, you create one or more classes adorned with an <code><a href=\"api/core/NgModule\" class=\"code-anchor\">NgModule</a></code> decorator\nthat describes Angular assets in metadata. The differences blossom from there.</p>\n<p>In a hybrid application you run both versions of Angular at the same time.\nThat means that you need at least one module each from both AngularJS and Angular.\nYou will import <code><a href=\"api/upgrade/static/UpgradeModule\" class=\"code-anchor\">UpgradeModule</a></code> inside the NgModule, and then use it for\nbootstrapping the AngularJS module.</p>\n<div class=\"alert is-helpful\">\n<p>For more information, see <a href=\"guide/ngmodules\">NgModules</a>.</p>\n</div>\n<h3 id=\"bootstrapping-hybrid-applications\">Bootstrapping hybrid applications<a title=\"Link to this heading\" class=\"header-link\" aria-hidden=\"true\" href=\"guide/upgrade#bootstrapping-hybrid-applications\"><i class=\"material-icons\">link</i></a></h3>\n<p>To bootstrap a hybrid application, you must bootstrap each of the Angular and\nAngularJS parts of the application. You must bootstrap the Angular bits first and\nthen ask the <code><a href=\"api/upgrade/static/UpgradeModule\" class=\"code-anchor\">UpgradeModule</a></code> to bootstrap the AngularJS bits next.</p>\n<p>In an AngularJS application you have a root AngularJS module, which will also\nbe used to bootstrap the AngularJS application.</p>\n<code-example path=\"upgrade-module/src/app/ajs-bootstrap/app.module.ts\" region=\"ng1module\" header=\"app.module.ts\">\nangular.module('heroApp', [])\n  .controller('MainCtrl', function() {\n    this.message = 'Hello world';\n  });\n\n</code-example>\n<p>Pure AngularJS applications can be automatically bootstrapped by using an <code>ng-app</code>\ndirective somewhere on the HTML page. But for hybrid applications, you manually bootstrap via the\n<code><a href=\"api/upgrade/static/UpgradeModule\" class=\"code-anchor\">UpgradeModule</a></code>. Therefore, it is a good preliminary step to switch AngularJS applications to use the\nmanual JavaScript <a href=\"https://docs.angularjs.org/api/ng/function/angular.bootstrap\"><code>angular.bootstrap</code></a>\nmethod even before switching them to hybrid mode.</p>\n<p>Say you have an <code>ng-app</code> driven bootstrap such as this one:</p>\n<code-example path=\"upgrade-module/src/index-ng-app.html\">\n&#x3C;!DOCTYPE <a href=\"api/core/SecurityContext#HTML\" class=\"code-anchor\">HTML</a>>\n&#x3C;html lang=\"en\">\n  &#x3C;head>\n    &#x3C;base href=\"/\">\n    &#x3C;script src=\"https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/angularjs/1.5.3/angular.js\">&#x3C;/script>\n    &#x3C;script src=\"app/ajs-ng-app/app.module.js\">&#x3C;/script>\n  &#x3C;/head>\n\n  &#x3C;body ng-app=\"heroApp\" ng-strict-di>\n    &#x3C;div id=\"<a href=\"api/common/http/HttpErrorResponse#message\" class=\"code-anchor\">message</a>\" ng-controller=\"MainCtrl as mainCtrl\">\n      {{ mainCtrl.message }}\n    &#x3C;/div>\n  &#x3C;/body>\n&#x3C;/html>\n\n\n</code-example>\n<p>You can remove the <code>ng-app</code> and <code>ng-strict-di</code> directives from the HTML\nand instead switch to calling <code>angular.bootstrap</code> from JavaScript, which\nwill result in the same thing:</p>\n<code-example path=\"upgrade-module/src/app/ajs-bootstrap/app.module.ts\" region=\"bootstrap\" header=\"app.module.ts\">\nangular.bootstrap(document.body, ['heroApp'], { strictDi: true });\n\n</code-example>\n<p>To begin converting your AngularJS application to a hybrid, you need to load the Angular framework.\nYou can see how this can be done with SystemJS by following the instructions in <a href=\"guide/upgrade-setup\">Setup for Upgrading to AngularJS</a> for selectively copying code from the <a href=\"https://github.com/angular/quickstart\">QuickStart github repository</a>.</p>\n<p>You also need to install the <code>@angular/upgrade</code> package via <code>npm install @angular/upgrade --save</code>\nand add a mapping for the <code>@angular/upgrade/<a href=\"api/upgrade/static\" class=\"code-anchor\">static</a></code> package:</p>\n<code-example path=\"upgrade-module/src/systemjs.config.1.js\" region=\"upgrade-static-umd\" header=\"systemjs.config.js (map)\">\n'@angular/upgrade/<a href=\"api/upgrade/static\" class=\"code-anchor\">static</a>': 'npm:@angular/upgrade/bundles/upgrade-static.umd.js',\n\n</code-example>\n<p>Next, create an <code>app.module.ts</code> file and add the following <code><a href=\"api/core/NgModule\" class=\"code-anchor\">NgModule</a></code> class:</p>\n<code-example path=\"upgrade-module/src/app/ajs-a-hybrid-bootstrap/app.module.ts\" region=\"ngmodule\" header=\"app.module.ts\">\nimport { <a

One of the more common patterns for doing that is to use an Angular component\nin an AngularJS context. This could be a completely new component or one that was\npreviously AngularJS but has been rewritten for Angular.</p>\n<p>Say you have a simple Angular component that shows information about a hero:</p>\n<code-example path=\"upgrade-module/src/app/downgrade-static/hero-detail.component.ts\" header=\"hero-detail.component.ts\">\nimport { <a href=\"api/core/Component\" class=\"code-anchor\">Component</a> } from '@angular/core';\n\n@<a href=\"api/core/Component\" class=\"code-anchor\">Component</a>({\n  selector: 'hero-detail',\n  template: `\n    &#x3C;h2>Windstorm details!&#x3C;/h2>\n    &#x3C;div>&#x3C;label>id: &#x3C;/label>1&#x3C;/div>\n  `\n})\nexport class HeroDetailComponent { }\n\n\n</code-example>\n<p>If you want to use this component from AngularJS, you need to <em>downgrade</em> it\nusing the <code><a href=\"api/upgrade/static/downgradeComponent\" class=\"code-anchor\">downgradeComponent</a>()</code> method. The result is an AngularJS\n<em>directive</em>, which you can then register in the AngularJS module:</p>\n<code-example path=\"upgrade-module/src/app/downgrade-static/app.module.ts\" region=\"downgradecomponent\" header=\"app.module.ts\">\nimport { HeroDetailComponent } from './hero-detail.component';\n\n/* . . . */\n\nimport { <a href=\"api/upgrade/static/downgradeComponent\" class=\"code-anchor\">downgradeComponent</a> } from '@angular/upgrade/<a href=\"api/upgrade/static\" class=\"code-anchor\">static</a>';\n\nangular.module('heroApp', [])\n  .directive(\n    'heroDetail',\n    <a href=\"api/upgrade/static/downgradeComponent\" class=\"code-anchor\">downgradeComponent</a>({ component: HeroDetailComponent }) as angular.IDirectiveFactory\n  );\n\n\n</code-example>\n<p>Because <code>HeroDetailComponent</code> is an Angular component, you must also add it to the\n<code>declarations</code> in the <code>AppModule</code>.</p>\n<p>And because this component is being used from the AngularJS module, and is an entry point into\nthe Angular application, you must add it to the <code>entryComponents</code> for the\nNgModule.</p>\n<code-example path=\"upgrade-module/src/app/downgrade-static/app.module.ts\" region=\"ngmodule\" header=\"app.module.ts\">\nimport { HeroDetailComponent } from './hero-detail.component';\n\n@<a href=\"api/core/NgModule\" class=\"code-anchor\">NgModule</a>({\n  imports: [\n    <a href=\"api/platform-browser/BrowserModule\" class=\"code-anchor\">BrowserModule</a>,\n    <a href=\"api/upgrade/static/UpgradeModule\" class=\"code-anchor\">UpgradeModule</a>\n  ],\n  declarations: [\n    HeroDetailComponent\n  ],\n  entryComponents: [\n    HeroDetailComponent\n  ]\n})\nexport class AppModule {\n  constructor(private upgrade: <a href=\"api/upgrade/static/UpgradeModule\" class=\"code-anchor\">UpgradeModule</a>) { }\n  ngDoBootstrap() {\n    this.upgrade.bootstrap(document.body, ['heroApp'], { strictDi: true });\n  }\n}\n\n</code-example>\n<div class=\"alert is-helpful\">\n<p>All Angular components, directives and pipes must be declared in an NgModule.</p>\n</div>\n<p>The net result is an AngularJS directive called <code>heroDetail</code>, that you can\nuse like any other directive in AngularJS templates.</p>\n<code-example path=\"upgrade-module/src/index-downgrade-static.html\" region=\"usecomponent\">\n&#x3C;hero-detail>&#x3C;/hero-detail>\n\n</code-example>\n<div class=\"alert is-helpful\">\n<p>Note that this AngularJS is an element directive (<code>restrict: 'E'</code>) called <code>heroDetail</code>.\nAn AngularJS element directive is matched based on its <em>name</em>.\n<em>The <code>selector</code> metadata of the downgraded Angular component is ignored.</em></p>\n</div>\n<p>Most components are not quite this simple, of course. Many of them\nhave <em>inputs and outputs</em> that connect them to the outside world. An\nAngular hero detail component with inputs and outputs might look\nlike this:</p>\n<code-example path=\"upgrade-module/src/app/downgrade-io/hero-detail.component.ts\" header=\"hero-detail.component.ts\">\nimport { <a href=\"api/core/Component\" class=\"code-anchor\">Component</a>, <a href=\"api/core/EventEmitter\" class=\"code-anchor\">EventEmitter</a>, <a href=\"api/core/Input\" class=\"code-anchor\">Input</a>, <a href=\"api/core/Output\" class=\"code-anchor\">Output</a> } from '@angular/core';\nimport { Hero } from '../hero';\n\n@<a href=\"api/core/Component\" class=\"code-anchor\">Component</a>({\n  selector: 'hero-detail',\n  template: `\n    &#x3C;h2>{{hero.name}} details!&#x3C;/h2>\n    &#x3C;div>&#x3C;label>id: &#x3C;/label>{{hero.id}}&#x3C;/div>\n    &#x3C;button (click)=\"onDelete()\">Delete&#x3C;/button>\n  `\n})\nexport class HeroDetailComponent {\n  @<a href=\"api/core/Input\" class=\"code-anchor\">Input</a>() hero: Hero;\n  @<a href=\"api/core/Output\" class=\"code-anchor\">Output</a>() deleted = new <a href=\"api/core/EventEmitter\" class=\"code-anchor\">EventEmitter</a>&#x3C;Hero>();\n  onDelete() {\n    this.deleted.emit(this.hero);\n  }\n}\n\n\n</code-example>\n<p>These inputs and outputs can be supplied from the AngularJS template, and the\n<code><a href=\"api/upgrade/static/downgradeComponent\" class=\"code-anchor\">downgradeComponent</a>()</code> method takes care of wiring them up:</p>\n<code-example path=\"upgrade-module/src/index-downgrade-io.html\" region=\"usecomponent\">\n&#x3C;div ng-controller=\"MainController as mainCtrl\">\n  &#x3C;hero-detail [hero]=\"mainCtrl.hero\"\n               (deleted)=\"mainCtrl.onDelete($event)\">\n  &#x3C;/hero-detail>\n&#x3C;/div>\n\n</code-example>\n<p>Note that even though you are in an AngularJS template, <strong>you're using Angular\nattribute syntax to bind the inputs and outputs</strong>. This is a requirement for downgraded\ncomponents. The expressions themselves are still regular AngularJS expressions.</p>\n<div class=\"callout is-important\">\n<header>\n  Use kebab-case for downgraded component attributes\n</header>\n<p>There's one notable exception to the rule of using Angular attribute syntax\nfor downgraded components. It has to do with input or output names that consist\nof multiple words. In Angular, you would bind these attributes using camelCase:</p>\n<code-example format=\"\">\n  [myHero]=\"hero\"\n</code-example>\n<p>But when using them from AngularJS templates, you must use kebab-case:</p>\n<code-example format=\"\">\n  [my-hero]=\"hero\"\n</code-example>\n</div>\n<p>The <code>$event</code> variable can be used in outputs to gain access to the\nobject that was emitted. In this case it will be the <code>Hero</code> object, because\nthat is what was passed to <code>this.deleted.emit()</code>.</p>\n<p>Since this is an AngularJS template, you can still use other AngularJS\ndirectives on the element, even though it has Angular binding attributes on it.\nFor example, you can easily make multiple copies of the component using <code>ng-repeat</code>:</p>\n<code-example path=\"upgrade-module/src/index-downgrade-io.html\" region=\"userepeatedcomponent\">\n&#x3C;div ng-controller=\"MainController as mainCtrl\">\n  &#x3C;hero-detail [hero]=\"hero\"\n               (deleted)=\"mainCtrl.onDelete($event)\"\n               ng-repeat=\"hero in mainCtrl.heroes\">\n  &#x3C;/hero-detail>\n&#x3C;/div>\n\n</code-example>\n<h3 id=\"using-angularjs-component-directives-from-angular-code\">Using AngularJS Component Directives from Angular Code<a title=\"Link to this heading\" class=\"header-link\" aria-hidden=\"true\" href=\"guide/upgrade#using-angularjs-component-directives-from-angular-code\"><i class=\"material-icons\">link</i></a></h3>\n<img src=\"generated/images/guide/upgrade/a-to-ajs.png\" alt=\"Using an AngularJS component from Angular code\" class=\"left\" width=\"250\" height=\"44\">\n<p>So, you can write an Angular component and then use it from AngularJS\ncode. This is useful when you start to migrate from lower-level\ncomponents and work your way up. But in some cases it is more convenient\nto do things in the opposite order: To start with higher-level components\nand work your way down. This too can be done using the <code><a href=\"api/upgrade/static\" class=\"code-anchor\">upgrade/static</a></code>.\nYou can <em>upgrade</em> AngularJS component directives and then use them from\nAngular.</p>\n<p>Not all kinds of AngularJS directives can be upgraded.

When you use the component from an Angular template,\nprovide the inputs and outputs using <strong>Angular template syntax</strong>,\nobserving the following rules:</p>\n<table>\n  <tbody><tr>\n

This reduces startup time and increases efficiency, especially when running different frameworks in the same application.</p>\n<p>When migrating large applications from AngularJS to Angular using a hybrid approach, you want to migrate some of the most commonly used features first, and only use the less commonly used features if needed. Doing so helps you ensure that the application is still providing a seamless experience for your users while you are migrating.</p>\n<p>In most environments where both Angular and AngularJS are used to render the application, both frameworks are loaded in the initial bundle being sent to the client. This results in both increased bundle size and possible reduced performance.</p>\n<p>Overall application performance is affected in cases where the user stays on Angular-rendered pages because the AngularJS framework and application are still loaded and running, even if they are never accessed.</p>\n<p>You can take steps to mitigate both bundle size and performance issues. By isolating your AngularJS app to a separate bundle, you can take advantage of <a href=\"guide/glossary#lazy-loading\">lazy loading</a> to load, bootstrap, and render the AngularJS application only when needed. This strategy reduces your initial bundle size, defers any potential impact from loading both frameworks until absolutely necessary, and keeps your application running as efficiently as possible.</p>\n<p>The steps below show you how to do the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Setup a callback function for your AngularJS bundle.</li>\n<li>Create a service that lazy loads and bootstraps your AngularJS app.</li>\n<li>Create a routable component for AngularJS content</li>\n<li>Create a custom <code><a href=\"api/router/Route#matcher\" class=\"code-anchor\">matcher</a></code> function for AngularJS-specific URLs and configure the Angular <code><a href=\"api/router/Router\" class=\"code-anchor\">Router</a></code> with the custom matcher for AngularJS routes.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"create-a-service-to-lazy-load-angularjs\">Create a service to lazy load AngularJS<a title=\"Link to this heading\" class=\"header-link\" aria-hidden=\"true\" href=\"guide/upgrade#create-a-service-to-lazy-load-angularjs\"><i class=\"material-icons\">link</i></a></h3>\n<p>As of Angular version 8, lazy loading code can be accomplished simply by using the dynamic import syntax <code>import('...')</code>.

This decreases the initial bundle size of your application as you're not loading code your user doesn't need yet. You also need to provide a way to <em>bootstrap</em> the application manually after it has been loaded. AngularJS provides a way to manually bootstrap an application using the <a href=\"https://docs.angularjs.org/api/ng/function/angular.bootstrap\">angular.bootstrap()</a> method with a provided HTML element. Your AngularJS app should also expose a <code>bootstrap</code> method that bootstraps the AngularJS app.</p>\n<p>To ensure any necessary teardown is triggered in the AngularJS app, such as removal of global listeners, you also implement a method to call the <code>$rootScope.destroy()</code> method.</p>\n<code-example path=\"upgrade-lazy-load-ajs/src/app/angularjs-app/index.ts\" header=\"angularjs-app\">\nimport * as angular from 'angular';\nimport 'angular-route';\n\nconst appName = 'myApp';\n\nangular.module(appName, [\n  'ngRoute'\n])\n.config(['$routeProvider', '$locationProvider',\n  function <a href=\"api/router/Router#config\" class=\"code-anchor\">config</a>($routeProvider, $locationProvider) {\n    $locationProvider.html5Mode(true);\n\n    $routeProvider.\n      when('/users', {\n        template: `\n          &#x3C;p>\n            Users Page\n          &#x3C;/p>\n        `\n      }).\n      otherwise({\n        template: ''\n      });\n  }]\n);\n\nexport function bootstrap(el: HTMLElement) {\n  return angular.bootstrap(el,  [appName]);\n}\n\n\n</code-example>\n<p>Your AngularJS application is configured with only the routes it needs to render content. The remaining routes in your application are handled by the Angular Router. The exposed <code>bootstrap</code> method is called in your Angular app to bootstrap the AngularJS application after the bundle is loaded.</p>\n<div class=\"alert is-important\">\n<p><strong>Note:</strong> After AngularJS is loaded and bootstrapped, listeners such as those wired up in your route configuration will continue to listen for route changes. To ensure listeners are shut down when AngularJS isn't being displayed, configure an <code>otherwise</code> option with the <a href=\"https://docs.angularjs.org/api/ngRoute/provider/$routeProvider\">$routeProvider</a> that renders an empty template.

The <code><a href=\"api/router/Route#matcher\" class=\"code-anchor\">matcher</a></code> allows you to use custom pattern matching for URL paths. The Angular Router tries to match on more specific routes such as static and variable routes first. When it doesn't find a match, it then looks at custom matchers defined in your route configuration.

Since\nTypeScript is a super-set of ECMAScript 2015, which in turn is a super-set\nof ECMAScript 5, you can simply switch the file extensions from <code>.js</code> to <code>.ts</code>\nand everything will work just like it did before. As the TypeScript compiler\nruns, it emits the corresponding <code>.js</code> file for every <code>.ts</code> file and the\ncompiled JavaScript is what actually gets executed. If you start\nthe project HTTP server with <code>npm start</code>, you should see the fully functional\napplication in your browser.</p>\n<p>Now that you have TypeScript though, you can start benefiting from some of its\nfeatures. There's a lot of value the language can provide to AngularJS applications.</p>\n<p>For one thing, TypeScript is a superset of ES2015. Any app that has previously\nbeen written in ES5 - like the PhoneCat example has - can with TypeScript\nstart incorporating all of the JavaScript features that are new to ES2015.\nThese include things like <code>let</code>s and <code>const</code>s, arrow functions, default function\nparameters, and destructuring assignments.</p>\n<p>Another thing you can do is start adding <em>type safety</em> to your code. This has\nactually partially already happened because of the AngularJS typings you installed.\nTypeScript are checking that you are calling AngularJS APIs correctly when you do\nthings like register components to Angular modules.</p>\n<p>But you can also start adding <em>type annotations</em> to get even more\nout of TypeScript's type system. For instance, you can annotate the checkmark\nfilter so that it explicitly expects booleans as arguments. This makes it clearer\nwhat the filter is supposed to do.</p>\n<code-example path=\"upgrade-phonecat-1-typescript/app/core/checkmark/checkmark.filter.ts\" header=\"app/core/checkmark/checkmark.filter.ts\">\nangular.\n  module('core').\n  filter('checkmark', function() {\n    return function(input: boolean) {\n      return input ? '\\u2713' : '\\u2718';\n    };\n  });\n\n\n</code-example>\n<p>In the <code>Phone</code> service, you can explicitly annotate the <code>$resource</code> service dependency\nas an <code>angular.resource.IResourceService</code> - a type defined by the AngularJS typings.</p>\n<code-example path=\"upgrade-phonecat-1-typescript/app/core/phone/phone.service.ts\" header=\"app/core/phone/phone.service.ts\">\nangular.\n  module('core.phone').\n  factory('Phone', ['$resource',\n    function($resource: angular.resource.IResourceService) {\n      return $resource('phones/:phoneId.json', {}, {\n        <a href=\"api/animations/query\" class=\"code-anchor\">query</a>: {\n          method: 'GET',\n          params: {phoneId: 'phones'},\n          isArray: true\n        }\n      });\n    }\n  ]);\n\n\n</code-example>\n<p>You can apply the same trick to the application's route configuration file in <code>app.config.ts</code>,\nwhere you are using the location and route services. By annotating them accordingly TypeScript\ncan verify you're calling their APIs with the correct kinds of arguments.</p>\n<code-example path=\"upgrade-phonecat-1-typescript/app/app.config.ts\" header=\"app/app.config.ts\">\nangular.\n  module('phonecatApp').\n  <a href=\"api/router/Router#config\" class=\"code-anchor\">config</a>(['$locationProvider', '$routeProvider',\n    function <a href=\"api/router/Router#config\" class=\"code-anchor\">config</a>($locationProvider: angular.ILocationProvider,\n                    $routeProvider: angular.route.IRouteProvider) {\n      $locationProvider.hashPrefix('!');\n\n      $routeProvider.\n        when('/phones', {\n          template: '&#x3C;phone-list>&#x3C;/phone-list>'\n        }).\n        when('/phones/:phoneId', {\n          template: '&#x3C;phone-detail>&#x3C;/phone-detail>'\n        }).\n        otherwise('/phones');\n    }\n  ]);\n\n\n</code-example>\n<div class=\"alert is-helpful\">\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.npmjs.com/package/@types/angular\">AngularJS 1.x type definitions</a>\nyou installed are not officially maintained by the Angular team,\nbut are quite comprehensive. It is possible to make an AngularJS 1.x application\nfully type-annotated with the help of these definitions.</p>\n<p>If this is something you wanted to do, it would be a good idea to enable\nthe <code>noImplicitAny</code> configuration option in <code>tsconfig.json</code>. This would\ncause the TypeScript compiler to display a warning when there's any code that\ndoes not yet have type annotations. You could use it as a guide to inform\nus about how close you are to having a fully annotated project.</p>\n</div>\n<p>Another TypeScript feature you can make use of is <em>classes</em>. In particular, you\ncan turn component controllers into classes. That way they'll be a step\ncloser to becoming Angular component classes, which will make life\neasier once you upgrade.</p>\n<p>AngularJS expects controllers to be constructor functions. That's exactly what\nES2015/TypeScript classes are under the hood, so that means you can just plug in a\nclass as a component controller and AngularJS will happily use it.</p>\n<p>Here's what the new class for the phone list component controller looks like:</p>\n<code-example path=\"upgrade-phonecat-1-typescript/app/phone-list/phone-list.component.ts\" header=\"app/phone-list/phone-list.component.ts\">\nclass PhoneListController {\n  phones: any[];\n  orderProp: string;\n  <a href=\"api/animations/query\" class=\"code-anchor\">query</a>: string;\n\n  <a href=\"api/upgrade/static\" class=\"code-anchor\">static</a> $inject = ['Phone'];\n  constructor(Phone: any) {\n    this.phones = Phone.query();\n    this.orderProp = 'age';\n  }\n\n}\n\nangular.\n  module('phoneList').\n  component('phoneList', {\n    <a href=\"api/core/Component#templateUrl\" class=\"code-anchor\">templateUrl</a>: 'phone-list/phone-list.template.html',\n    controller: PhoneListController\n  });\n\n\n</code-example>\n<p>What was previously done in the controller function is now done in the class\nconstructor function. The dependency injection annotations are attached\nto the class using a static property <code>$inject</code>. At runtime this becomes the\n<code>PhoneListController.$inject</code> property.</p>\n<p>The class additionally declares three members: The array of phones, the name of\nthe current sort key, and the search query. These are all things you have already\nbeen attaching to the controller but that weren't explicitly declared anywhere.\nThe last one of these isn't actually used in the TypeScript code since it's only\nreferred to in the template, but for the sake of clarity you should define all of the\ncontroller members.</p>\n<p>In the Phone detail controller, you'll have two members: One for the phone\nthat the user is looking at and another for the URL of the currently displayed image:</p>\n<code-example path=\"upgrade-phonecat-1-typescript/app/phone-detail/phone-detail.component.ts\" header=\"app/phone-detail/phone-detail.component.ts\">\nclass PhoneDetailController {\n  phone: any;\n  mainImageUrl: string;\n\n  <a href=\"api/upgrade/static\" class=\"code-anchor\">static</a> $inject = ['$routeParams', 'Phone'];\n  constructor($routeParams: angular.route.IRouteParamsService, Phone: any) {\n    let phoneId = $routeParams['phoneId'];\n    this.phone = Phone.get({phoneId}, (phone: any) => {\n      this.setImage(phone.images[0]);\n    });\n  }\n\n  setImage(imageUrl: string) {\n    this.mainImageUrl = imageUrl;\n  }\n}\n\nangular.\n  module('phoneDetail').\n  component('phoneDetail', {\n    <a href=\"api/core/Component#templateUrl\" class=\"code-anchor\">templateUrl</a>: 'phone-detail/phone-detail.template.html',\n    controller: PhoneDetailController\n  });\n\n\n</code-example>\n<p>This makes the controller code look a lot more like Angular already. You're\nall set to actually introduce Angular into the project.</p>\n<p>If you had any AngularJS services in the project, those would also be\na good candidate for converting to classes, since like controllers,\nthey're also constructor functions. But you only have the <code>Phone</code> factory\nin this project, and that's a bit special since it's an <code>ngResource</code>\nfactory. So you won't be doing anything to it in the preparation stage.\nYou'll instead turn it directly into an Angular service.</p>\n<h3 id=\"installing-angular\">Installing Angular<a title=\"Link to this heading\" class=\"header-link\" aria-hidden=\"true\" href=\"guide/upgrade#installing-angular\"><i class=\"material-icons\">link</i></a></h3>\n<p>Having completed the preparation work, get going with the Angular\nupgrade of PhoneCat. You'll do this incrementally with the help of\n<a href=\"guide/upgrade#upgrading-with-ngupgrade\">ngUpgrade</a> that comes with Angular.\nBy the time you're done, you'll be able to remove AngularJS from the project\ncompletely, but the key is to do this piece by piece without breaking the application.</p>\n<div class=\"alert is-important\">\n<p>The project also contains some animations.\nYou won't upgrade them in this version of the guide.\nTurn to the <a href=\"guide/animations\">Angular animations</a> guide to learn about that.</p>\n</div>\n<p>Install Angular into the project, along with the SystemJS module loader.\nTake a look at the results of the <a href=\"guide/upgrade-setup\">upgrade setup instructions</a>\nand get the following configurations from there:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Add Angular and the other new dependencies to <code>package.json</code></li>\n<li>The SystemJS configuration file <code>systemjs.config.js</code> to the project root directory.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Once these are done, run:</p>\n<code-example format=\"\">\n  npm install\n</code-example>\n<p>Soon you can load Angular dependencies into the application via <code>index.html</code>,\nbut first you need to do some directory path adjustments.\nYou'll need to load files from <code>node_modules</code> and the project root instead of\nfrom the <code>/app</code> directory as you've been doing to this point.</p>\n<p>Move the <code>app/index.html</code> file to the project root directory. Then change the\ndevelopment server root path in <code>package.json</code> to also point to the project root\ninstead of <code>app</code>:</p>\n<code-example format=\"\">\n  \"start\": \"http-server ./ -a localhost -p 8000 -c-1\",\n</code-example>\n<p>Now you're able to serve everything from the project root to the web browser. But you do <em>not</em>\nwant to have to change all the image and data paths used in the application code to match\nthe development setup.

As described\nby the <a href=\"guide/dependency-injection\">Dependency Injection Guide</a>,\nthis is a marker decorator you need to use for classes that have no other\nAngular decorators but still need to have their dependencies injected.</p>\n<p>In its constructor the class expects to get the <code><a href=\"api/common/http/HttpClient\" class=\"code-anchor\">HttpClient</a></code> service. It will\nbe injected to it and it is stored as a private field. The service is then\nused in the two instance methods, one of which loads the list of all phones,\nand the other loads the details of a specified phone:</p>\n<code-example path=\"upgrade-phonecat-2-hybrid/app/core/phone/phone.service.ts\" region=\"fullclass\" header=\"app/core/phone/phone.service.ts\">\n@<a href=\"api/core/Injectable\" class=\"code-anchor\">Injectable</a>()\nexport class Phone {\n  constructor(private <a href=\"api/common/http\" class=\"code-anchor\">http</a>: <a href=\"api/common/http/HttpClient\" class=\"code-anchor\">HttpClient</a>) { }\n  <a href=\"api/animations/query\" class=\"code-anchor\">query</a>(): Observable&#x3C;PhoneData[]> {\n    return this.http.get&#x3C;PhoneData[]>(`phones/phones.json`);\n  }\n  get(id: string): Observable&#x3C;PhoneData> {\n    return this.http.get&#x3C;PhoneData>(`phones/${id}.json`);\n  }\n}\n\n</code-example>\n<p>The methods now return observables of type <code>PhoneData</code> and <code>PhoneData[]</code>.

Right now it contains a TypeScript\ncontroller class and a component definition object. You can morph this into\nan Angular component by just renaming the controller class and turning the\nAngularJS component definition object into an Angular <code>@<a href=\"api/core/Component\" class=\"code-anchor\">Component</a></code> decorator.\nYou can then also remove the static <code>$inject</code> property from the class:</p>\n<code-example path=\"upgrade-phonecat-2-hybrid/app/phone-list/phone-list.component.ts\" region=\"initialclass\" header=\"app/phone-list/phone-list.component.ts\">\nimport { <a href=\"api/core/Component\" class=\"code-anchor\">Component</a> } from '@angular/core';\nimport { Phone, PhoneData } from '../core/phone/phone.service';\n\n@<a href=\"api/core/Component\" class=\"code-anchor\">Component</a>({\n  selector: 'phone-list',\n  <a href=\"api/core/Component#templateUrl\" class=\"code-anchor\">templateUrl</a>: './phone-list.template.html'\n})\nexport class PhoneListComponent {\n  phones: PhoneData[];\n  <a href=\"api/animations/query\" class=\"code-anchor\">query</a>: string;\n  orderProp: string;\n\n  constructor(phone: Phone) {\n    phone.query().subscribe(phones => {\n      this.phones = phones;\n    });\n    this.orderProp = 'age';\n  }\n/* . . . */\n}\n\n</code-example>\n<p>The <code>selector</code> attribute is a CSS selector that defines where on the page the component\nshould go.

E2E tests aren't really that\nconcerned with the internal structure of the application components. That\nalso means that, although you modify the project quite a bit during the upgrade, the E2E\ntest suite should keep passing with just minor modifications. You\ndidn't change how the application behaves from the user's point of view.</p>\n<p>During TypeScript conversion, there is nothing to do to keep E2E tests\nworking.

But it may be\na good idea to convert the unit test code into TypeScript as well.</p>\n<p>For instance, in the phone detail component spec, you can use ES2015\nfeatures like arrow functions and block-scoped variables and benefit from the type\ndefinitions of the AngularJS services you're consuming:</p>\n<code-example path=\"upgrade-phonecat-1-typescript/app/phone-detail/phone-detail.component.spec.ts\" header=\"app/phone-detail/phone-detail.component.spec.ts\">\ndescribe('phoneDetail', () => {\n\n  // Load the module that contains the `phoneDetail` component before each test\n  beforeEach(angular.mock.module('phoneDetail'));\n\n  // Test the controller\n  describe('PhoneDetailController', () => {\n    let $httpBackend: angular.IHttpBackendService;\n    let ctrl: any;\n    let xyzPhoneData = {\n      name: 'phone xyz',\n      images: ['image/url1.png', 'image/url2.png']\n    };\n\n    beforeEach(inject(($componentController: any,\n                       <a href=\"\" class=\"code-anchor\">_</a>$httpBackend_: angular.IHttpBackendService,\n                       $routeParams: angular.route.IRouteParamsService) => {\n      $httpBackend = <a href=\"\" class=\"code-anchor\">_</a>$httpBackend_;\n      $httpBackend.expectGET('phones/xyz.json').respond(xyzPhoneData);\n\n      $routeParams['phoneId'] = 'xyz';\n\n      ctrl = $componentController('phoneDetail');\n    }));\n\n    it('should fetch the phone details', () => {\n      jasmine.addCustomEqualityTester(angular.equals);\n\n      expect(ctrl.phone).toEqual({});\n\n      $httpBackend.flush();\n      expect(ctrl.phone).toEqual(xyzPhoneData);\n    });\n\n  });\n\n});\n\n\n</code-example>\n<p>Once you start the upgrade process and bring in SystemJS, configuration changes\nare needed for Karma. You need to let SystemJS load all the new Angular code,\nwhich can be done with the following kind of shim file:</p>\n<code-example path=\"upgrade-phonecat-2-hybrid/karma-test-shim.1.js\" header=\"karma-test-shim.js\">\n// /*<a href=\"api/core/global\" class=\"code-anchor\">global</a> jasmine, __karma__, window*/\nError.stackTraceLimit = 0; // \"No stacktrace\"\" is usually best for app testing.\n\n// Uncomment to get <a href=\"api/core/Version#full\" class=\"code-anchor\">full</a> stacktrace output.
